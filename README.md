## 🚀 How to Simulate the Project

There are **two ways** to run the simulation, depending on whether you have just downloaded the project or you have already built it before.

### ▶️ Way 1 — First Time (Just Downloaded / Cloned the Project)

If you have just downloaded the project, you **must build the workspace first**.

**1.** Open a terminal, go to the workspace and build it:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
```

**2.** Launch the simulation (terminal 1 — keep it running):

```bash
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py    # terminal 1
```

> ⚠️ **Important** — Wait until Gazebo and all controllers are fully up (about **15 – 20 seconds**) before running the next commands.

**3.** Open a second terminal to watch what the gripper camera sees:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view /wrist_camera/image_raw    # terminal 2
```

**4.** Open a third terminal and run the scan and pick node:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 run ur_lab scan_pick
```

The node spawns three cubes (red, blue and yellow — colours are shuffled on every run) in a line on the table, sweeps the arm across the line while the wrist camera classifies the colour of the cube under the gripper, and as soon as it detects the **RED** cube it stops, descends, grasps it and lifts it.

### 🔁 Way 2 — Already Built the Project Before

If you have already built the workspace, you do **NOT** need to run `colcon build` again. You only need to source the environments in every new terminal, then run the same commands.

**Terminal 1** — launch the simulation:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2** — camera view (optional):

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view /wrist_camera/image_raw
```

**Terminal 3** — scan and pick:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 run ur_lab scan_pick
```

---

## 💡 Extra Notes

> ❗ The simulation **must already be running** before you start any node that interacts with the robot (`scan_pick`, `pick_cube`, `move_robot`).

> ❗ You **must source both environments** (ROS and the workspace) in **EVERY** new terminal you open.

- If you use **Bash** instead of **Zsh**, replace `setup.zsh` with `setup.bash` in every command.
- Other available demo nodes:

```bash
ros2 run ur_lab move_robot    # moves the arm along a fixed trajectory
ros2 run ur_lab pick_cube     # spawns one cube, grasps and lifts it
```

---

## 🎯 Unity Simulation

Besides Gazebo, this project also supports simulation in **Unity 2022.3.62f3** using the `ur_lab_unity_bridge` package. If you want to simulate the project in Unity instead of Gazebo, follow the steps below.

> ⚠️ **Important** — The workspace must already be built before running the Unity simulation. If you have just downloaded the project, build it first:
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/Downloads/ros2_ws
> colcon build --symlink-install
> source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
> source install/setup.zsh
> ```

**Terminal 1** — launch the ROS-Unity bridge (keep it running):

```bash
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source /mnt/c/Users/Amir/Downloads/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh

ros2 launch ur_lab_unity_bridge unity_sim.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2** — open the Unity project and load the `Lab` scene:

```bash
~/Unity/Hub/Editor/2022.3.62f3/Editor/Unity -projectPath ~/unity_ws/UR5eUnity -openfile ~/unity_ws/UR5eUnity/Assets/Scenes/Lab.unity
```

> ⚠️ Wait until the Unity editor has fully loaded the `Lab` scene before running the next commands.
> 📦 **Where to get this Unity project** — it lives in its own repository. Clone it once:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/unity_ws
> git clone git@github.com:amiriguesss/UR5eUnity.git ~/unity_ws/UR5eUnity
> ```
>
> On first open, Unity imports the assets and resolves the pinned packages
> (`ros-tcp-connector v0.7.0`, `urdf-importer v0.5.2`) automatically. The
> required `ROS2` scripting define is already stored in the project's
> `ProjectSettings`, so no extra setup is needed.


**Terminal 3** — run the scan and pick node:

```bash
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source /mnt/c/Users/Amir/Downloads/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh

ros2 run ur_lab scan_pick
```

> ℹ️ `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1` keeps all ROS 2 communication on the local machine, which is required for the Unity-ROS bridge to communicate correctly.

> ℹ️ The same commands work with Bash by replacing `setup.zsh` with `setup.bash`.

```

> ℹ️ MoveIt is **not** required just to launch the Gazebo simulation.

---

## 📥 Clone the Project

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Create the ROS 2 Workspace

It is recommended to keep the workspace inside the Linux filesystem.

Use:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
```

Then:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

> ⚠️ **WSL users** — Avoid placing the workspace under `/mnt/c/Users/...`.
> Prefer `/home/<username>/ros2_ws` instead of `/mnt/c/Users/<username>/ros2_ws`.
> This avoids many filesystem, symlink, and build-performance problems.

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Clone the Repository

From inside `~/ros2_ws`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amiriguesss/ROS2.git .
```

Check the repository:

```bash
ls
```

You should see:

```text
src
```

Check the source directory:

```bash
ls src
```

You should have:

```text
ur_lab
Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation
```

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Verify the Universal Robots Simulation Package

The project depends on the Universal Robots Gazebo simulation package.

Check:

```bash
find src -maxdepth 3 -name package.xml -print
```

You should see:

```text
src/ur_lab/package.xml
src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation/ur_simulation_gazebo/package.xml
```

The Universal Robots simulation repository should be on the `humble` branch.

Check:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation
git branch --show-current
```

Expected output:

```text
humble
```

Return to the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

---

## 🔧 Install Project Dependencies

### 1️⃣6️⃣ Source ROS 2

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

### 1️⃣7️⃣ Install All Project Dependencies

From the workspace root:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

Run:

```bash
rosdep update
```

Then:

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

A successful installation should end with something similar to:

```text
#All required rosdeps installed successfully
```

> ℹ️ If some dependencies are already installed, that is completely fine.

---

## 🏗️ Build the Workspace

### 1️⃣8️⃣ Clean Previous Builds

If this is a fresh clone, this is **optional**.

If you previously built the project or moved the workspace, it is recommended:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
rm -rf build install log
```

> ℹ️ This removes only generated build files. It does **not** remove your source code.

### 1️⃣9️⃣ Build the Project

Source ROS 2 first.

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

Then build:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
```

A successful build should finish with something similar to:

```text
Summary: 2 packages finished
```

> ℹ️ The exact number may change if additional packages are added later.

### 2️⃣0️⃣ Source the Workspace

After a successful build:

**Bash:**

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

---
## 🔍 Verify the Build

### 2️⃣1️⃣ Check the ROS Packages

Check the project package:

```bash
ros2 pkg prefix ur_lab
```

Expected output:

```text
/home/<username>/ros2_ws/install/ur_lab
```

Check the Universal Robots simulation:

```bash
ros2 pkg prefix ur_simulation_gazebo
```

Expected output:

```text
/home/<username>/ros2_ws/install/ur_simulation_gazebo
```

You can also list the UR packages:

```bash
ros2 pkg list | grep ur_
```

You should see packages similar to:

```text
ur_calibration
ur_client_library
ur_controllers
ur_dashboard_msgs
ur_description
ur_lab
ur_moveit_config
ur_msgs
ur_robot_driver
ur_simulation_gazebo
```

---

## 🧪 Test Gazebo

Before launching the complete project, make sure Gazebo itself works.

Run:

```bash
gazebo
```

Gazebo Classic should open.

Close it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

---

## 🤖 Test the Universal Robots Simulation

Before running the custom `ur_lab` environment, it is recommended to test the underlying UR simulation.

Make sure ROS and your workspace are sourced.

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_simulation_gazebo ur_sim_control.launch.py
```

Gazebo should open with the simulated UR5e.

If this works correctly, the Universal Robots simulation is functioning.

Stop it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

---

## 🌎 Run the Complete Project

Once the basic UR simulation works, launch the actual project.

From the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

Source ROS:

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

Source the workspace:

**Bash:**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source install/setup.zsh
```

Now launch the project:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

---

## 🚀 Main Launch Command

Once everything has been installed and built, the complete project can be started with:

**Bash:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

> ℹ️ This is the **main command** for the project.

---

## 🎮 Running the Custom Nodes

The `ur_lab` package contains custom executable nodes.

List them:

```bash
ros2 pkg executables ur_lab
```

You should see:

```text
ur_lab add_scene
ur_lab move_robot
```

### 🧩 `add_scene`

Run:

```bash
ros2 run ur_lab add_scene
```

### 🦾 `move_robot`

Run:

```bash
ros2 run ur_lab move_robot
```

> ⚠️ The simulation should already be running before starting nodes that interact with the simulated robot.

---
## 🖥️ Recommended Terminal Workflow

A convenient workflow is to use multiple terminals.

**Terminal 1 — Gazebo / Simulation:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh

ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Robot Node:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh

ros2 run ur_lab move_robot
```

**Terminal 3 — Scene Node:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
source install/setup.zsh

ros2 run ur_lab add_scene
```

> ℹ️ The same commands work with Bash by replacing `.zsh` with `.bash`.

---

## 🐚 Zsh Configuration

If you use Zsh, you can automatically source ROS 2 and the workspace every time you open a terminal.

Run:

```bash
echo 'source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then:

```bash
echo 'source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can simply run:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Important: Workspace Paths

If you previously had the project somewhere else, for example `/mnt/c/Users/Amir/Downloads/ros2_ws`, and moved it to `/home/amir/ros2_ws`, your shell may still contain references to the old workspace.

Check:

```bash
echo $AMENT_PREFIX_PATH
```

and:

```bash
echo $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```

If you see an old path such as `/mnt/c/Users/.../ros2_ws/install`, clean the current shell:

```bash
unset AMENT_PREFIX_PATH
unset CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```

Then source ROS again:

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

Then source the current workspace:

**Bash:**

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

---

## 🧹 Completely Clean and Rebuild

If the project gets into a broken build state, perform a clean rebuild.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
```

Remove generated files:

```bash
rm -rf build install log
```

Source ROS:

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

Install dependencies again:

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Build:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Source the new workspace:

**Bash:**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source install/setup.zsh
```

Verify:

```bash
ros2 pkg prefix ur_lab
```

and:

```bash
ros2 pkg prefix ur_simulation_gazebo
```

---
## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ `ros2: command not found`

Source ROS 2:

**Bash:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

Check:

```bash
which ros2
```

Expected output:

```text
/opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2
```

### ❌ `Package 'ur_lab' not found`

Build and source the workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Then:

**Bash:**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

**Zsh:**

```bash
source install/setup.zsh
```

Then:

```bash
ros2 pkg prefix ur_lab
```

### ❌ `Package 'ur_simulation_gazebo' not found`

First check that the source package exists:

```bash
find ~/ros2_ws/src -name package.xml | grep ur_simulation_gazebo
```

You should have:

```text
~/ros2_ws/src/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation/ur_simulation_gazebo/package.xml
```

Check whether `colcon` sees it:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon list
```

You should see:

```text
ur_lab
ur_simulation_gazebo
```

If necessary, clean and rebuild:

```bash
rm -rf build install log
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.zsh
```

### ❌ `gazebo: command not found`

Install Gazebo Classic:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gazebo libgazebo-dev
```

Then:

```bash
gazebo --version
```

### ❌ Gazebo opens and immediately closes

First test Gazebo without ROS:

```bash
gazebo
```

If Gazebo itself fails, the issue is with the Gazebo/GUI environment rather than this ROS project.

### ❌ Build warnings about old `/mnt/c/...` paths

If you see:

```text
The path '/mnt/c/.../ros2_ws/install/...' in AMENT_PREFIX_PATH doesn't exist
```

your shell is probably still referencing an old workspace.

Run:

```bash
unset AMENT_PREFIX_PATH
unset CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```

Then:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
```

and:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

If the warning returns every time you open a new terminal, inspect:

```bash
grep -n "ros2_ws" ~/.zshrc
```

Remove references to the old workspace.

---

## 🔄 Updating the Project

If you already cloned the repository and want the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
git pull
```

Then rebuild:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.zsh
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.zsh
```

Then launch:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_lab sim.launch.py
```

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Simulation

To stop the ROS 2 launch:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

If Gazebo becomes stuck and refuses to close:

```bash
